# Clay's Personal Learning Log

For a few days I have been thinking about how I should go about my personal learning. While listening to a podcast from TDS, I heard about making an effort every day to "get in the gym" even if you don't work out as hard as possible. So, my goal will now be to get into the data science gym everyday starting today. This can be as much as working on a project, or as simple as reading a DS blog post. Please see my findings below!

## Continuous Learning Notes


* Deploying a Streamlit App with Heroku Tutorial
  * Date: 6/20/2020
  * Summary: This tutorial walked through how to deploy a streamlit app on a heroku server
  * Key Learnings:
    * How to build a streamlit app
    * How to deploy to heroku
    * Using github to sync with a Heroku Application
    * Final output (for father's day)
      * [my web app](https://enigmatic-springs-10364.herokuapp.com/)
* Data Science Infrastructure Podcast
  * Date: 6/21/2020
  * Summary: An interview with the founder of dotscience who goes over the challenges of ML Dev Ops and how it is fundamentally different that just software engineering.
  * Key Learnings:
    * Learning to deploy models in a sustainable manner (Docker, Kubes, CICD) is going to be a huge plus for any data scientist
    * Monitoring models should be done statistically, not via route logic
    * Think about "runs" instead of "code" when it comes to git for ML. This will incorporate data versioning as well as code versioning
